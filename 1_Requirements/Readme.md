# REQUIREMENTS

## INTRODUCTION
This project helps user to calculate All areas and perimeter of All geometric shapes

<br>

## RESEARCH
Calculation of Geometric Shapes and remembering all the area and perimeter of geometric shapes is much tedious so making system that can calculate all the shapes area and perimeter
<br>

# DEFINING THE SYSTEM
The system used here helps the user to calculate all Geometric Shapes 

<br>

# 4W'S AND 1 H

## WHO
Anyone who can find learning all formula 
## WHEN
Whenever doing math calculation
## WHAT
The system provides a solution to calculate it 
## WHERE
Can be used by anyone, anywhere
## HOW
With the available software infrastructure the system can be implemented

<br>
